    "description": "We helped Digirati to produce a HTML5 interactive timeline for English Heritage. The timeline is a reusable jQuery control for plotting historical events pertaining to EH properties in a scrollable/zoomable interface. Events appear as coloured timespans, their colour denoting whether they are of local or global significance. Users may click on a timespan to see additional audio/video media pertaining to the event in an overlay. Timelines may be linked together via timespans to create hierarchies of nested events.",
