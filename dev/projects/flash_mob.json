    "description": "We worked with our friends at The Progress Film Company to produce this fun interactive video viral for the Brighton based boutique lingerie company Ophelia Fancy. The viral stars Stevi and Emma, the two founders of Ophelia Fancy, and two of their close friends. The idea was to focus on the unique character of their company whilst also making their lingerie feel accessible to all.<br/>The viral is shot at locations around Brighton and the soundtrack is by Brighton band Derriere. Move the mouse from side to side to scrub the timeline and watch the flash again!",
